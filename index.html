        <h3> Gameplay</h3>
        <p>  The game continues with the traditional gameplay of the Mario Kart series, in which famous characters of Nintendo's Mario universe compete with one another in competitive racing in go-karts. In traditional gameplay, players try to make their way up to first place while trying to hinder other opponent's progress towards the same goal, using various items found in item boxes at some portions of the race. The game includes four different CCs, them being 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and 200cc, in which the first is automatically unlocked and the next two can be unlocked during gameplay, while the fourth being included with purchasing the Gold Pass. It also includes features from previous installments like underwater racing and hang gliding from Mario Kart 7. Mario Kart Tour includes several characters from previous games, with three new characters, them being Pauline making her Mario Kart debut, Peachette and a musician skin for Mario. Mario Kart Tour also re-features karts from previous games. The game also introduces a new item; Frenzy, in which the player can use their selected character's special ability while invincible. The game features 16 cups, with some tracks from previous cups being re-used and all races last two laps. The cups are also named after Mario characters instead of the usual items in the Mario franchise. As of September 26, 2019, the game currently does not have a multiplayer feature, but is scheduled to be available in the near future in an update.

Mario Kart Tour's gameplay is unique, with the game only requiring players to steer the kart, while the game helps to auto-accelerate their vehicle. In each course, a player can earn up to five Grand Stars, based on how many points they achieve. These points can be earned by choosing a suitable character, kart and glider, jump tricks and actions like hitting another player with an item and their own position. At the end of each cup, there is a unique type of race called Bonus Challenge Course, in which players are presented with unique circumstances and an objective. These challenges do not follow the usual gameplay of a regular race. If the player is able to achieve the set objective, they will earn one Grand Star. If they perform better and go beyond the set objective's requirement, they may be able to earn a further two more Grand Stars.

The game also introduces Challenges; players need to beat these challenges in order to earn either Rubies or Grand Stars. They will also get a badge if they beat that certain challenge, and can use it to display it during the loading screen before races.  </p>

        <h4> Tours </h4>
        <p> Mario Kart Tour introduces a new mechanic; Tours. Tours are usually named after famous cities in the world, and each tour usually lasts 2 weeks. During each tour, an original track will be available in some cups as part of the tour, as well as tour gifts which gives the player rewards like a new character, kart or glider once they have reached the Grand Star requirement.

        <h5>Characters </h5>
        
        <p> In Mario Kart Tour, different racers bring their own advantages to a race. Each <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-tour/Characters_-_List_of_Drivers#Character_Advantages_in_Mario_Kart_Tour">character</a> comes with their own special item that most other racers cannot find in Item Boxes.

In addition to this, depending on the race track, certain characters may have an advantage or disadvantage in the amount of Items they can hold at one time. This can be as many as 3 Items, or a low as only 1 Item at a time.

As a general rule, Ultra Rare characters have two course that they are able to use 3 Item Boxes in, while Rare characters have one course each. Each rarity type also has a base value of driver points that go towards your point score at the end of a race (to obtain Grand Stars). Common drivers start by giving you 400 points, Rare drivers add 450 to your score, and Ultra Rare drivers will give you 500 bonus points. By increasing the level of the driver and winning races, you'll be able to increase the amount of points they give. </p>
